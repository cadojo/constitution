_The Constitution of the United States of America._

> I want to interact with the Constitution in the format I'm most familar with.
> The creation of this repository was motivated by the first public hearing 
> provided by the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the 
> United States Capitol. Of course, the Constitution was not at-issue during the 
> attack on the Capital of the United States. Politically expedient lies and 
> deliberate misinformation were spread by many with high government rank, and 
> sacred trust gifted by the American public. Enemies of the Constitution, and 
> the spirit behind both it and our Country, lept at the sound of those calls. 
> 
> My goal, as I write this, is to connect with the spirit of my Country, and 
> the Constitution to which I've personally sworn an oath, on a deeper level
> through the best method I know. Open access and free information helps me 
> think through technical ideas within scientific computing. Why wouldn't
> this format serve my understanding of ideas relating to my home, and the
>  home of so many who I love?
